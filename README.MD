# ComfyUI gpu_downclock

Script to dynamically downclock selected NVIDIA GPUs with per-GPU clock settings.\
ComfyUI locks the clock high on the running GPU on Linux. This will help you save electricity and reduce heat generation.\
It worked on my TESLA V100, P100, and 3090.\
Still needs improvement.\
